Section 1: Creating Main Datasets for COSPRO corpora
NOTE: all steps that do not involve all COSPRO corpora will indicate specific corpora in parentheses 
	Phase 1 (Initial Steps):
		1. Extract all wav files in each corpus into an all_wav folder for that corpus (done in command line).
		2. Remove spaces from filenames either with apply_space_elimination.sh or in the command line 
		   (several packages in this process are unable to read filenames with spaces).
	Phase 2 (Creak Analysis):
		1. (COSPRO_04, COSPRO_07) Run resample_to_16000.sh to convert sample rate of ‘wav’ files from 44100 to 16000.
		   (The creak detection package used in this phase only works on files with a 16000 sample rate).
		2. Download John Kane’s creak detection package from https://github.com/jckane/Voice_Analysis_Toolkit.
		3. Run apply_creak_detection.sh with the directory of ‘wav’ files to be analyzed as the argument 
		   (An Output folder will be created in the given directory with ’txt’ files).
		4. Change ‘txt’ extension of output files to ‘creak’ using convert_txt_to_creak.sh.
		5. ____INPUT RELOCATION DIRECTIONS____
	
	Phase 3 (Reaper Analysis):
		1. Download Google’s Reaper package from https://github.com/google/REAPER.
		2. Run apply_reaper.sh with the directory to be analyzed as the argument
		   (An Output folder will be created in the given directory with ’f0’ files).
		   NOTE: this procedure assumes that the second data column in ‘f0’ files is pitchmark data that can also be obtained by 
		   running the reaper program to obtain ‘pm’ files — somewhat thorough checking has been done to confirm this. To get 
		   pitchmark data separately in ‘pm’ files, run apply_reaper.sh with line 20 commented out and line 19 uncommented.

	Phase 4 (VoiceSauce Analysis):
		1. Download Yen Shue’s VoiceSauce package from http://www.seas.ucla.edu/spapl/voicesauce/
		____COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS____ make sure to say run in MATLAB

	Phase 5 (Align Files):
		____COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS____
		- remove carriage return from break, adjusted (?)
		- run convert_to_15_intervals.py
		


Section 2: Creating Creak TextGrids for COSPRO and Childrens Corpus
	1. Do Phase 1 and 2 from Section 1, except for Step 5 in Phase 2.
	2. Run apply_txtGrid_converter.sh with the ONLY argument being the directory containing the ‘creak’ files from Section 1 Phase 2
	   (An Output folder will be created in the given directory with ’TextGrid’ files).
	3. ____INPUT RELOCATION DIRECTIONS____
