Childrenâ€™s Corpus Steps

1. Extracted first channel from each file with Audacity Script
2. Listened to each file to determine which ones were usable
3. Ran VoiceSauce Analysis on each usable file (ran in background for next few steps)
4. For each usable file, created a syllable textGrid that labels syllable intervals
5. Ran apply_TextGrid_labeler.sh which called textGrid_labeler.py on each file.
