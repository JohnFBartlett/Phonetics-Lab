Description of Files in Section 1 (Create Main Dataset for COSPRO corpora), Phase 5 (Align Files)


convert_to_15_intervals.py: (aligns data from various analysis types with segments in adjusted/phn files into 15 intervals of data per segment)

main function is format_files(partLength, adjusted, otherFile, outpath)
params:	
	- partLength: if otherFile is a directory, partlength indcates the number of seconds each file contains (either 5 or 10). This is for the when very large sound files had to be broken into smaller segments of 5 or 10 seconds to be analyzed.


This script aligns data from various analysis types with segments in adjusted/phn files, arranging the data into 15 intervals of data per segment. It takes in a part length (for very large files that were split into parts; otherwise this field is ignored), adjusted or phn file containing segments and their intervals, another file of either creak or reaper data, and an output path. 

The script navigates line by line through each adjusted
